Turn on the Simon game console to start a new game.
The game console will produce a short sequence of button presses, beginning with just one. For example, it may light up and play a sound for the red button.
You must replicate the exact sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons in the same order. If the sequence is "red," you press the red button.
The console will then add one more step to the sequence, and you must repeat the longer sequence accurately.
Continue to follow the pattern as it grows longer, always starting from the beginning of the sequence.
If you make a mistake and press the wrong button or get the order wrong, the game will signal the mistake, and the round will end.
The game will display your level, which represents how many steps you correctly completed in the sequence.
Scoring:
The level in the Simon game is typically based on the number of steps in the sequence you complete correctly before making a mistake. The higher your score, the better your memory and concentration skills are.
